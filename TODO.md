- support more than two choice variables when the integration dimension is `separable`
- plotrecipe for `DDPSolution`
- allow parametric types in problem definition of state and choice vectors, i.e. `AbstractVector{T}` instead of `Vector{Float64}`
- allow `LabelledArrays.jl` in problem definition
- allow discontinuities in the reward function with `monotonicity` and `concavity`
- support firm exit
